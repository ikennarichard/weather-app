## What I Learned

### Notification Routing

OneSignal interacts with platform-specific notification services:

- **Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)** for iOS
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for Android

These services wake up the user's device and deliver the message in real-time.

### Handling Notifications on the Client Side

When a push notification is received, the app decides whether to:

1. Display the notification as a system alert.
2. Perform an in-app action (e.g., navigate to the weather details screen).
